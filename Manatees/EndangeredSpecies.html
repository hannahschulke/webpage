			<p>Manatees are a fully aquatic and mostly herbivorous marine mammals. 
			They are also known as sea cows. The three living species of Manatees are the 
			Amazonian Manatee, West Indian Manatee and West African Manatee. They are very large animals
			that measure up to 13ft long and can weigh as much as 1,300lbs. They have paddle-like flippers
			which is why the are herbivores. Despite their size and stubbly snout, manatees seem cute
			and cuddly to many ocean visitors. These large, slow-moving marine mammals hang out in costal areas and rivers.</p>

			<h1>Why are Manatees called sea cows?</h1>
			
			<p>Manatees are called sea cows because they are slow plant-eaters
			much like cows. Also, they are peaceful and are similar to cows on land.
			They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.</p>

			<h1>Endangered Manatees</h1>
			
			<p>The West Indian Manatees in the United States are protected 
			under federal law by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. This
			makes it illegal to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal. Violations
			of these federal laws can be met with civil or criminal convictions associated with
			imprisonment. </p>

			<p>In Florida, Manatees were first protected by Florida State Law in 1893. Now, they are
			federally protected by both the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.</p>
