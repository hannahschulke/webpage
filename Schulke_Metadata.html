			 However, with putting some effort it becomes a simple and relaxing activity.</p>

			 <p>At mostly any beaches you visit, you can find a local surf company that teaches lessons. 
			 After registering and having this experience it is something you won't want to stop. The most
			 important skill to have for surfing is balance, but doesn't mean if you don't have good balance
			you won't enjoy it.</p>

			Also, while surfing you will experience some of the most breathtaking views. Such as beautiful sunsets,
			animals, and the site of waves barreling.</p>
