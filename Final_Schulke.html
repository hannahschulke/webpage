        <p>Patricia Billings studied art at Amarillo College, specialized in plaster of
        Paris sculptures. The turn in her life from art to technology came in the 1970s,
        when a swan sculpture, after months of hard work, fell and broke into pieces.<p>
           
        <p>She knew that Renaissance sculptors used a cement additive to give their 
        plaster longevity, so she set out to create a modern equivalent. After 8 years 
        of experimenting in her basement, she succeeded, inventing a milky additive that
        acts as a catalyst. When added to a mixture of gypsum and concrete, it creates 
        an indestructible plaster. But there was more, a scientist friend of Billings 
        realized that her new material was also incredibly resistant to heat. Billings
        returned to her lab, and in eight more years, she had created
        <a href="https://bennettmineral.com/agricultural/">Geobond</a>.

        <p>Billings won 2 patents for her work & true to her independent spirit, 
        she has turned down $20 million buyout offer from a company because she 
        kept the complete recipe a secret. GeoBond has also come to produce 
        unexpected benefits, including serving as a nontoxic alternative to 
        asbestos, which has been deemed a cancer-causing agent by the FDA.
        It is used today for <a href="http://www.unityparts.com/70200-geobond-roof-repair-1-gallon/">roof repair</a>.
    	Though the greatest potential of her invention has been borne out in the engineering 
        industry, Billingsâ€™s first love has always been art, and in keeping with her
        passion she has recently developed a new product called CraftCote. This 
        utilizes the GeoBond technology in an art-centric manner.</p>
